Goals:
    Now: get compiling and output from c++ code
    Next: get outputs matching python code




Thoughts
    - optimization: if we know n_metabolites_, we know dimension of matrices and vectors.
        - define different vector_t and matrix_t types inside class
    - optimization: build vectors/matrix inside Constraint class
        - or use std::move if they wont be used later.
Questions for Ethan
    - m.SvS is never used

USAGE NOTES
****************************************************************************
eigen objects and any object that contains an eigin object MUST be 
    passed by reference and never by value. or else memory become unaligned. 
    Returning by value is fine though.

when we are assigning a matrix expression to a matrix that appears
    in the expression, be sure to call .eval() on the RHS.
    Ex. A = A * B; should be A = (A * B).eval();

matrix_t A = B; performs a deep copy of B into A.

numpy array operation * is elementwise

eigen is lazy.
    - use .eval() to force strict evaluation of RHS.
    - this is particularly important for aliasing.
    - HOWEVER, component-wise operations are safe regardless
        and don't require forced evaluation.
        - "In general, an assignment is safe if the (i,j) 
            entry of the expression on the right-hand side 
            depends only on the (i,j) entry of the matrix or 
            array on the left-hand side and not on any other entries"

eigen in general does not perform operations in-place.
    - when an in-place alternative for func() exist, 
        it is usually called funcInPlace().


eigen matrix.reshaped() or .resize()?
    resize changes the matrix in place,
        whereas reshaped returns a new matrix.
    no way to specify coefficient order for resize.
    *resizing (both increasing and decreasing total 
        number of coefficients) will delete the current
        coefficients (replace with zeros) UNLESS the 
        total number of coefficients is unchanged.

matrix types only support linear -algebra operations, for 
    component wise operations, one must first call the matrix.array()
    to convert the matrix to an array.
    At the end of the operations, one then must call .matrix() 
    to convert the array back into a mtraix.
