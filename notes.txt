eigen is lazy.
    - use .eval() to force strict evaluation of RHS.
    - this is particularly important for aliasing.
    - HOWEVER, component-wise operations are safe regardless
        and don't require forced evaluation.
        - "In general, an assignment is safe if the (i,j) 
            entry of the expression on the right-hand side 
            depends only on the (i,j) entry of the matrix or 
            array on the left-hand side and not on any other entries"

eigen in general does not perform operations in-place.
    - when an in-place alternative for func() exist, 
        it is usually called funcInPlace().


eigen matrix.reshaped() or .resize()?
    resize changes the matrix in place,
        whereas reshaped returns a new matrix.
    no way to specify coefficient order for resize.
    *resizing (both increasing and decreasing total 
        number of coefficients) will delete the current
        coefficients (replace with zeros) UNLESS the 
        total number of coefficients is unchanged.
